  description <<-EOS
  Packr is a program for compressing JavaScript programs. It can remove comments
  and whitespace, compress variable names, obfuscate '_private' identifiers, and
  base-62 encode your programs. It can also generate source maps, which lets
  your browser trace log messages and errors back to the original source, even
  when running minified code.
  
  When invoked from the command line, it concatenates all the code in
  INPUT_FILES (or from standard input) and compresses the code using the given
  options, printing the result to standard output. If the --output option is
  used, the result is written to the given file along with a source map.

  Path to which to write compressed output; output will be written to stdout
  unless this is passed. If this option is used with a list of INPUT_FILES then
  a source map will also be written to OUTPUT_FILE.map.

  notes <<-EOS
  This program is not a JavaScript parser, and rewrites your files using regular
  expressions. Be sure to include semicolons and braces everywhere they are
  required so that your program will work correctly when packed down to a single
  line.
  
  By far the most efficient way to serve JavaScript over the web is to use Packr
  with the --shrink-vars flag, combined with gzip compression.
  
  If you really cannot serve gzip files, use the --base62 option to further
  compress your code. This mode is at its best when compressing large files with
  many repeated tokens.
  
  The --private option can be used to stop other programs calling private methods
  in your code by renaming anything beginning with a single underscore. Beware
  that you should not use this if the generated file contains 'private' methods
  that need to be accessible by other files. Also know that all the files that
  access any particular private method must be compressed together so they all
  get the same rewritten name for the private method.
